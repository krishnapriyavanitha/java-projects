🔢 Fibonacci Series Website using Java

I developed a simple educational website that explains the Fibonacci Series and demonstrates its implementation using Java. The project focuses on logic building, core Java concepts, and algorithmic thinking, while using HTML and CSS to present the content in a clear and user-friendly way.

This project helped me strengthen my Java programming and problem-solving skills.

🎯 Number Guessing Game using Java

I developed a Number Guessing Game using Java, where the program generates a random number and the user tries to guess it within limited attempts. The game provides feedback such as “too high” or “too low”, helping users improve their logical thinking.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals, loops, conditional statements, random number generation, and user input handling.
